An article written in Jupyter Notebook about Molecular Theory for the academic period 2017-I at the career of Computer Science of University of Engineering and Technology, Lima, Peru.

This notebook can be used to show some capabilities of Python and Jupyter Notebook :snake:, to explain Molecular Theory. You will see graphs in 2D and 3D.

PS: The article is written in Spanish :es:
